#linedodger

A basic game made with pygame where you have to avoid the walls. Controls are: { "Arrow Keys": "Controls", "q": "Quit", "Begin": "space" }

All you have to do to run the game is to run game.py and have both the schedule and pygames packages installed. 
You can get those packages with "pip install schedule pygame" or "pip3 install schedule pygame". 
You can run the game with "python game.py" or "python3 game.py".
